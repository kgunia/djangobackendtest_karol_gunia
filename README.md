Instructions on recreating base environment

If the above steps fail:
1. Make sure you have Pipenv installed. More on it: https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-pipenv
2. If installation is impossible feel free to use pip with requirements.txt AND Python 3.7

Scenario
========
You are asked to create a CRM for sales team in your company. The CRM is used by company's employees. The company is selling to customers three models of cars:
1. Red
2. Green 
3. Blue

!!!! You are asked to create a BACKEND application - i.e. no frontend-related code is necessary and will not be graded.

Task
====
This section describes which functionalities should the CRM submitted by you have:

1. Ability to add users from django's admin panel - PLEASE SHARE WITH US USERNAME AND PASSWORD OF THE SUPERUSER
2. Users have the following characteristics:
    - first and last name
    - email - it has to have @anulujkredyt.pl in it
    - permission level - either basic or high
    - password
3. User authentication - login as the email. Do not worry about security aspects for now. Tip: feel free to follow general guidelines for setting up basic authentication: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/
4. Ability to add customers, outside of django admin panel, with the following details:
    - first and last name
    - telephone - no more than 9 digits and no spaces
    - email - needs to have @ character in it
    - first and last name cannot repeat themselves. I.e. there can be Jan Nowak and Jerzy Nowak but there cannot be two people whose names and surnames are Jan Nowak.
    - only person with high permission level can add customer 
5. Ability to delete customers, outside of django admin panel, from the database - only person with high permission level can do that.
6. Ability to edit customer details, outside of django admin panel, given customer's id
7. Ability to add a purchase, outside of django admin panel, done by the customer of one of the cars: red, blue or green
8. Ability to list all purchases, outside of django admin panel, inside a database with the following characteristics:
    - possibility to filter customers who made the purchase 
9. There has to be an API documentation, separate endpoint, which describes url addresses and their parameters/queries - tip: feel free to Swagger or whatever other documentation tool
10. There has to be unit test coverage and you have to report on that coverage - tip: feel free to use external packages such as django-nose

!!!! You are asked to create a BACKEND application - i.e. no frontend-related code is necessary and will not be graded.

Restrictions
============
None! Use whatever tools / third party libraries you feel are necessary to complete the task. Feel free to consult whatever external resources you see fit. There is nothing wrong with using already existing resources.
